# FFMPEG Installation Tutorial
To get screen recording to work you need to install FFmpeg to Geometry Dash
- download [FFmpeg](https://github.com/absolllute/ffmpeg-build/releases/download/v1/ffmpeg.exe)
- extract the 7z folder with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (or equivalent tools)
- open the "bin" folder from the extract 
- copy ffmpeg.exe to your GD install folder (**not** the extensions folder)
- all done

## How to find your GD install folder
- Open Steam
- Go to Library
- Right click Geometry Dash
- Manage
- Browse Local Files
- all done!

## Why?
FFmpeg uses a sinful license that makes it awkward to package for distribution

Later builds of Mega Hack will avoid requiring this extra step, but for now this is required unfortunately
